Boy Scout / Venturing VOA Web Site
==================================
This was a short-lived project to develop a Web site for a Boy Scout group I was a part of.

The idea is that different *crews* would put on different activities and different crews could
post their events. Other crews could then view other events and join along with them.

This was made with the [Yii Framework](http://yiiframework.com).
